# ðŸ¤– ML-Experiments

Welcome to **ML-Experiments** â€” a hands-on machine learning playground where I explore and implement core ML models from scratch and through libraries. This repo documents my learning journey through practical implementations, not just theory.

---

## ðŸ“š What's Inside?

A collection of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks covering:

### âœ… Core Models
- **Linear Regression** â€“ Simple and multiple linear regression
- **Logistic Regression** â€“ Binary classification from scratch and with `sklearn`
- **Multiclass Classification** â€“ One-vs-rest, softmax-based classifiers
- **Cost Functions & Gradient Descent** â€“ Custom implementations for full control

### ðŸ”¬ Practice Work
- Experimentation with:
  - Normalization & scaling
  - Train/test splits
  - Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
  - Decision boundaries visualization
  - Error analysis and optimizations

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Python** (obviously ðŸ˜Ž)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
- **scikit-learn**
---

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals

- Reinforce theoretical understanding of ML models through code
- Understand how libraries like `scikit-learn` implement these under the hood
- Improve debugging, visualization, and model evaluation skills
- Build intuition for when and how to use different models

---

## ðŸ§  Status

This repo is a work-in-progress as I keep learning and adding more experiments. Expect:
- Model tweaks
- More datasets
- Comparison experiments
- Newer algorithms soon (SVMs, Trees, maybe Neural Nets ðŸ‘€)

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Install requirements (if any, usually NumPy + Matplotlib)
3. Run Jupyter Notebook or the `.py` files directly

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ML-Experiments.git
cd ML-Experiments
jupyter notebook
